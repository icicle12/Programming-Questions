/* MAX Profit Problem
Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:

The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 
1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
